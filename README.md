## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and `pip` installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manoramapatel12345/Oil_Spill_Data_Analysis.git
   cd Oil_Spill_Data_Analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:
1. **Loading Data**: Reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Identifying and handling missing values appropriately.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removing or correcting inconsistent data entries.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance model performance.
5. **Data Transformation**: Normalizing or scaling data to prepare it for analysis.

The preprocessing steps are documented in the `oil_spill_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involves:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating summary statistics to understand the distribution and central tendency of the data.
2. **Data Visualization**: Creating plots and charts to visualize data distributions, relationships, and patterns.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing the correlation between different variables to identify potential relationships.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers and anomalies in the data.

The EDA steps are documented in the `oil_spill_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Results

The results of the analysis are documented in the Jupyter notebook and can be visualized using the plots and charts generated during the EDA process. Additional detailed analysis can be found in the `oil_spill_data_analysis.pdf` file.
